# Music on Console Framebuffer (mocf)

Music on Console Framebuffer (mocf) is a lightweight ncurses audio player
forked from Music on Console Player (mocp). Targeting minimal resource usage
for smoother playback on constrained systems, the project trims out
non-essential features to apply sane defaults for low-end, non-accelerated,
software-rendered environments like framebuffer consoles.

The interface features a dual-pane layout reminiscent of Midnight Commander.
Native directory handling allows you to simply select a file to begin playback
for the entire folder. While playlists are not required, complex queues can be
built, saved, and exported as m3u files.

### Key Features

*   Client-server architecture for persistent playback.
*   Gapless playback via song precaching.
*   Native PulseAudio backend and modern FFmpeg (> 4.0) support.
*   Support for OSS, ALSA, SNDIO, and JACK output drivers.
*   Integrated song rating system.
*   Inotify support for automatic directory refreshing.
*   Reworked audio formats with support for 32-bit samples and float processing.
*   Simple software mixer and a cache for file tags.
*   Customizable color themes and user-defined keybindings.
*   Stripped non-essential features for a minimal default build.
*   Optimized defaults for software-rendered and terminal environments.

## Supported Formats

Supported formats include MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Musepack, Speex, Opus, WAVE,
and formats handled by FFmpeg/LibAV (e.g., WMA, AAC, MP4). Additional
support includes AIFF, AU, SID, wavpack, MIDI, and modplug.

## Building and Installation

This project uses the **CMake** build system.

### Installation Directories

You can customize the installation location:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
```

## Usage

Run the program with the `mocf` command. The usage is simple and designed to
be as intuitive as basic functions in Midnight Commander.

```bash
mocf
```

If you need help, press `h` inside the program or read the manpage
(`man mocf`).

### Configuration

Using a configuration file is not required. If you choose to create one,
it should be placed at `~/.mocf/config`. See the `config.example` file for a
full list of options and documentation.

### Themes

Themes control the color scheme of the interface. An example theme is included
in `assets/themes/`. Custom themes should be placed in `~/.mocf/themes/`.

The active theme can be selected with the `Theme` option in your config file
or by using the `-T` command-line option.

### Keymaps

You can redefine the default keybindings by creating a custom keymap file. See
the instructions in the `keymap.example` file for details on the format and a
full list of available commands.
